# Turtle-Road-Cross
One of the python projects which I created

This is a simple game created from the turtle module in Python. The goal of this game to move the turtle to the other end of the road without colliding with the oncoming vehicles. Everytime, the player successfully crosses the road, the turtle would once again start from the inital starting point but this time the speed of the oncoming vehicle will have been increased.
